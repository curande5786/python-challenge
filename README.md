# python-challenge

# This folder contains two challenges, PyBank and PyPoll.

# PyBank is a challenge in which a small .csv file containing month to month profits must be analyzed to determine total profit, average profit or loss month over month, and when the greatest increase and decrease in profit occurred.

# PyPoll is a challenge in which a .csv file containing voter data for a "small rural town" with over 3,000,000 voters must be analyzed to determine how many ballots were cast, how many votes each candidate got and their percentage of the total, and who won.
